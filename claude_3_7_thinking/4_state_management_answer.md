# State Management in NextFaster

This codebase primarily uses **Next.js Server Actions** for state management. Evidence of this includes:

1. The presence of `"use server"` directive in files like actions.ts, which defines server-side functions for cart operations:

   ```typescript
   "use server";

   import { getCart, updateCart } from "./cart";

   export async function addToCart(prevState: unknown, formData: FormData) {
     /*...*/
   }
   ```

2. A custom middleware layer in middleware.ts that adds validation to server actions:

   ```typescript
   export function validatedAction<S extends z.ZodType<any, any>, T>(
     schema: S,
     action: ValidatedActionFunction<S, T>
   ) {
     // ...handles validation and passes data to the action
   }
   ```

3. Authentication-related actions in actions.ts that manipulate cookies:
   ```typescript
   export async function signOut() {
     // clear session & cart
     const c = await cookies();
     c.getAll().forEach((cookie) => c.delete(cookie.name));
   }
   ```

The application appears to follow the modern Next.js pattern of using Server Components with Server Actions for state management, rather than traditional client-side state management libraries like Redux or MobX (which aren't present in the dependencies).

Additional state may be managed through cookies for persistence across requests, particularly for authentication and cart data.
