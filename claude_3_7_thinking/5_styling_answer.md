# Styling Solution Analysis

This codebase uses **Tailwind CSS** as its primary styling solution, with several additional supporting tools:

## Core Styling Framework

- **Tailwind CSS** (version 3.4.14 as indicated in the pnpm-lock.yaml file)
- CSS utility classes are extensively used throughout the JSX/TSX components

## Evidence in the Codebase

- The globals.css file includes the standard Tailwind directives:

  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```

- A comprehensive tailwind.config.ts configuration file that extends the default theme with custom:

  - Colors (including accent1, accent2)
  - Border radius values
  - Font families

- Extensive use of utility classes in components:
  ```tsx
  className =
    "flex flex-row flex-wrap justify-center gap-2 border-b-2 py-4 sm:justify-start";
  ```

## Supporting Tools

- **class-variance-authority (cva)** for creating component variants with a consistent API
- **clsx** and **tailwind-merge** utilities for conditional class composition (via the `cn()` utility)
- **tailwindcss-animate** plugin for animations
- **postcss-hover-media-feature** as a PostCSS plugin
- **prettier-plugin-tailwindcss** for optimized class ordering in the codebase

The project appears to follow a component-based architecture similar to Shadcn UI patterns, with reusable UI components that leverage Tailwind's utility classes.
